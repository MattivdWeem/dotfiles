Dotfiles
========

Keep the dotfiles where-ever you want, I personally prefer keeping them in `~/dotfiles`. Then when you want to take them into use run `source bootstrap.sh` which will `git pull` the latest version from the repo and copy them into your `~` dir.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/kvendrik/dotfiles.git && source bootstrap.sh
```

## Updating
```
source bootstrap.sh
```
